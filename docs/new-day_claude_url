This document is an amalgamation of the original narrative provided by the user and the project working notes from another chat. It outlines the user's learning environment, preferences, and the specific Python scripting project they are working on. Please refer to the sections below for detailed information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Original Narative
I'm learning Python and have my environment fully set up:
- Neovim with LazyVim and Copilot working
- tmux with split-screen setup (learn-python command)
- IPython in right pane, Neovim in left
- vim-slime configured (Space+sv sends code to IPython)
- Git repo at ~/python-learning/basics/daily/
- Fish shell on CachyOS Linux

I have ADHD and learn best with:
- Visual examples and colorful output
- Small, working code chunks I can run immediately
- Understanding the WHY behind concepts
- Hands-on practice over theory

I want to start with Python basics and build up. I'll be creating daily practice files (day01.py, day02.py, etc.) to track progress. Can you help me learn Python with practical, visual exercises that I can type, test with Copilot's help, and run immediately in IPython?

Let's start with day01.py covering variables and basic data types with fun, visual examples.

# Project working from another chat:

# Network Routes Python Script - Complete Project Handoff

## Project Overview
Converting a bash script that manages persistent network routes via NetworkManager into a Python script for learning purposes. The learner has ADHD/AuDHD and learns best with visual mental models, understanding the "WHY" behind everything, and step-by-step incremental progress.

## Learning Context & Teaching Approach
- **Learner Profile**: AuDHD, needs to visualize complete picture before details, persistent but needs "WHY" explanations
- **Teaching Method**: Mentor/guide approach - provide direction and concepts, let learner implement and discover
- **Pace**: Incremental steps with verification at each stage
- **Debugging Style**: Help identify issues but let learner fix them

## Technical Context

### Network Architecture
- Development lab environment with isolated networks
- Networks are NOT routed externally (security isolation)  
- Routes must be "direct routes" (Gateway = 0.0.0.0) through ethernet interface
- Networks are switched/VLAN accessible directly via enp1s0f1 interface
- Without these routes, traffic tries to go through wireless gateway and fails

### Original Bash Script Purpose
The original `routes.sh` script:
1. Defines array of lab network routes (18 routes total)
2. Uses `nmcli con modify` to add persistent routes to NetworkManager
3. Restarts connection and NetworkManager service to apply changes
4. Routes survive interface up/down cycles due to NetworkManager persistence

### Key Technical Insights Learned
1. **Routing Table Storage**: `/proc/net/route` contains active kernel routes in hex format with little-endian byte ordering
2. **NetworkManager Config**: Persistent routes stored in `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/npl.nmconnection`
3. **Configuration Format**: INI-style with `route1=10.1.0.0/25`, `route2=...` indexing
4. **Hybrid Network Config**: `method=auto` (DHCP) with static route overlay

## Current Script Status

### Completed Functionality âœ…
1. **File Reading**: Successfully reads NetworkManager config file
2. **Section Parsing**: Correctly identifies and processes [ipv4] section  
3. **Route Extraction**: Extracts clean IP/subnet values from `route1=10.1.0.0/25` format
4. **Data Structures**: Three organized lists:
   - `current_routes[]`: Routes currently in config file
   - `new_routes[]`: Desired routes (from original bash array)
   - `adding_routes[]`: Routes that need to be added
   - `merged_routes[]`: Final combined list
5. **Smart Comparison**: Only adds routes that don't already exist (exact string matching)

### Current Working Code
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
#
# Script author: Bryan Magalski
# email: bamagalski@scires.com
# Date: Sep 16, 2025
# version: 1.0
#
##### Description
# Adds routes to files in /etc/NetowkrManager/system-connections. The purpose for writing was that each reboot,
# the routes would be cleared from teh routing table. This script checks the file for existing routes and ony adds
# routes that are not already present.
#
#
##### Instructions
# Make changes to the the variables as needed. No need to modify script unless verisioning.
#
#  service_name: NetworkManager is the default here
#  new_routes: added entire range as default. change by adding/removing routes as needed. Entire route table was
#               added in order to ensure that an empty nmconnection file would not cause breakage.
#  route_dir: /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections is the default location. Change if needed.
#  route_file: npl.nmconnection is the default file name. Change if needed.
#
#
##### Change Log
#
# v1.2:
#   added "ip route" command to display current routes in the routing table after restart.
#
# v1.1:
#   added systemctl command to ensure routes take on the connection
#
# v1.0 (release):
#   Fleshed out the writing to file and printing of the changed status.
#
# v0.1.2 (final beta):
#   Added all routes to new_routes list in the event that a restart or change in ethernet port clears the table.
#
# v0.1.1 (beta):
#   Created open file loop and added all basic variables for that seciton.
#   Cleaned up initial comments/algorithm statements.
#
# v0.1 (initial):
#   Laid out comments with intentions of writing script.

```

## Next Immediate Step: File Writing

### The Challenge
Need to write `merged_routes[]` back to the config file with:
1. **Preserve** all non-route content
2. **Replace** existing route lines with merged list
3. **Format** as `route1=10.1.0.0/25`, `route2=...` etc.
4. **Maintain** file structure integrity

### Approach Started
Two-phase file surgery:
1. **Read entire file**, reconstruct line by line
2. **Skip existing route lines**, insert new formatted routes
3. **Write reconstructed content** back to file

### Technical Pattern Identified
```python
new_file_content = []
# Read file, skip old route lines, preserve everything else
# When exiting [ipv4] section, insert formatted merged_routes
# Write new_file_content back to file
```

## Key Learning Achievements
1. **Systems Thinking**: Understanding kernel vs service vs config file layers
2. **Data Normalization**: Converting different formats for comparison
3. **Algorithm Design**: Smart merge logic avoiding duplicates
4. **Python Skills**: File I/O, string manipulation, list operations, f-strings
5. **Professional Practices**: Clean variable names, modular code, debugging output

## Teaching Notes for Continuation
- Continue incremental approach with verification at each step
- Let learner implement file writing logic with guidance
- Focus on understanding WHY each piece works
- Provide mental models for file manipulation concepts
- Encourage experimentation and "play time"
- Celebrate achievements and maintain enthusiasm

## Final Implementation Needs
1. File writing with route formatting (`route1=`, `route2=`, etc.)
2. Backup mechanism for safety
3. Error handling
4. Optional: NetworkManager restart/reload functionality
5. Optional: Verification that routes applied correctly

## Environment Details
- Python 3.13.7 in virtual environment
- Linux system with NetworkManager
- Connection name: "npl"
- Lab network ranges: 10.1.x.x and 10.2.x.x primarily
- Copilot in LazyVim for coding assistance
- Jupyter notebooks for testing concepts
- Pip environment set up at ~/.venvs/learn/
- Github repo set up for ~/python-learning with .gitignore, README.md and LICENSE
- Python-learning folder has a basics/daily/ structure for daily practice files with template that increments for each day
  - Was intended for basic python learning but now also used for this project as we are doing more advanced scripting
  - Daily should focus on small, visual, incremental learning chunks from the previously provided Python learning curriculum
