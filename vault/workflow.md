## 1️⃣ Morning Check-in (5 minutes)

### For Python Learners:
```bash
cd ~/learn-programming
git pull  # Get latest changes from the crew

# Open your progress tracker
cat progress-trackers/python-tracker.md | grep "Day [0-9]" | grep -v "\[x\]" | head -5
```

**Ask yourself:**
- ✅ What day am I on?
- ✅ Do I have time for a full day today, or just review?
- ✅ Am I stuck on anything from yesterday?

### For C Learners:
```bash
cd ~/learn-programming
git pull

# Check your progress
cat progress-trackers/c-tracker.md | grep "\[ \]" | head -10
```

**Ask yourself:**
- ✅ Which module am I working on?
- ✅ Do I understand the previous concept well enough to move forward?
- ✅ Do I need to re-read or practice yesterday's material?

---

## 2️⃣ Choose Today's Focus (2 minutes)

### 🎯 Decision Tree

```
Do you have 60+ minutes today?
├─ YES → Full new lesson
└─ NO → Short practice or review
    ├─ 30-60 min → Review + practice problems
    ├─ 15-30 min → Review notes + run existing code
    └─ < 15 min → Read ahead / watch video only
```

### 🧠 Brain State Check

**Feeling sharp? 🚀**
- Tackle new concepts
- Try challenging exercises
- Build new features

**Feeling tired? 😴**
- Review previous lessons
- Type out code you've already written
- Watch videos / read documentation
- Organize notes

**Feeling stuck? 🤔**
- Ask on Discord
- Draw diagrams
- Work on a different section
- Take a walk and come back

---

## 3️⃣ Learn Phase (30-45 minutes)

### Python 100 Days Structure:
```bash
cd python/100-days-bootcamp/[section]/day[XX]-[topic]

# Read the README first
cat README.md

# Watch the video lesson (if applicable)
# Take notes in notes.md as you go
```

### C Low-Level Structure:
```bash
cd c/lowlevel-academy/module[XX]-[topic]

# Read the README
cat README.md

# Read any provided materials
# Take notes in notes.md
```

### 📝 Active Learning Checklist

While learning, DO these things:
- [ ] **Pause and predict** - Before seeing the code, try to guess what it should look like
- [ ] **Ask WHY** - For every new concept, ask "Why does this work this way?"
- [ ] **Draw it** - Create simple diagrams in your notes
- [ ] **Connect it** - How does this relate to what you learned yesterday?
- [ ] **Question it** - What would happen if I changed X?

### 🖼️ Visual Learning Technique

**For memory-related concepts (pointers, addresses, etc.):**

```
Step 1: Draw boxes representing memory
Step 2: Label each box with an address
Step 3: Draw arrows showing pointers
Step 4: Trace the flow of your program

Save these drawings! Take a photo or scan them.
Put them in vault/diagrams/personal/
```

**For logic flow concepts (if/else, loops, etc.):**

```
Step 1: Draw a flowchart
Step 2: Mark each decision point
Step 3: Trace a few example inputs through
Step 4: Identify where you get confused

This is WHERE to focus your attention!
```

## 4️⃣ Code Phase (30-45 minutes)

### 🎯 Coding Principles

**Type, don't copy-paste:**
- Muscle memory helps learning
- You'll catch errors you wouldn't otherwise notice
- Forces you to think about each line

**Start from scratch:**
- Don't look at the solution initially
- Try to write it from memory
- When stuck, peek at notes, not the full solution

**Break it down:**
- Don't try to write the whole program at once
- Write one function, test it
- Write the next function, test it
- Build up gradually

### 🔧 The Coding Loop

```
1. Read the requirements
    ↓
2. Plan your approach (comments/pseudocode)
    ↓
3. Write a small piece
    ↓
4. Test it
    ↓
5. Is it working?
    ├─ YES → Move to next piece
    └─ NO → Debug
        ├─ Print statements
        ├─ Check assumptions
        └─ Ask for help if stuck > 20 min
```

### 🐛 When You Get an Error

**DON'T:** Immediately Google or ask for help  
**DO:** Follow this process first

```
1. READ the error message carefully
   - What line number?
   - What does it say in plain English?

2. CHECK the obvious
   - Typos?
   - Missing semicolon/colon?
   - Indentation?
   - Variable name correct?

3. ADD debug output
   - Print values before the error
   - Print values after the error
   - Does your data look right?

4. UNDERSTAND the error
   - What is the computer expecting?
   - What did you give it?
   - Why is there a mismatch?

5. SEARCH the error
   - Copy the error message
   - Google: "[error message] [language]"
   - Read Stack Overflow answers

6. ASK the crew
   - Explain what you're trying to do
   - Show your code
   - Explain what you've tried
   - Ask specific questions
```

### ⏱️ Time Management

**Set a timer!** This is crucial for ADHD management:

```
25 minutes CODING
↓
5 minute break
↓
25 minutes CODING  
↓
5 minute break
↓
25 minutes CODING
↓
15 minute break
```

**During breaks:**
- Stand up and stretch
- Get water
- Look away from screen
- DON'T scroll social media (black hole!)

## 5️⃣ Reflect & Document (10 minutes)

### ✅ Check Off Progress

**Python Learners:**
```bash
# Edit your tracker
vim progress-trackers/python-tracker.md

```

**C Learners:**
```bash
vim progress-trackers/c-tracker.md

# Check off the concepts you completed
```

### 🎨 Add Visual Aids (Optional but Encouraged!)

If you drew any helpful diagrams today:
```bash
# Save your diagram
cp ~/path/to/diagram.png vault/diagrams/personal/day[XX]-concept.png

# Document it
echo "## Day [XX] - [Concept]" >> vault/diagrams/personal/index.md
echo "![Diagram](./day[XX]-concept.png)" >> vault/diagrams/personal/index.md
echo "This diagram shows..." >> vault/diagrams/personal/index.md
```

4. Google the specific error or concept

### Stuck for 1 hour?
1. Post on Discord with:
   - What you're trying to do
   - What's happening
   - What you've tried
   - Your code (formatted!)
2. Work on something else while waiting
3. Don't spiral into frustration

### Stuck for 1 day?
1. Take a break from this specific problem
2. Work on a different day/module
3. Come back with fresh eyes tomorrow
4. It's okay to be stuck! This is normal!

## 📊 Measuring Progress

### ✅ Good Indicators You're Learning:
- You can explain concepts in your own words
- You can write code without looking at examples
- You catch your own errors before running code
- You can help answer others' questions
- You're building things you're proud of

### ❌ Don't Measure Success By:
- How fast you complete days
- How few errors you get
- Comparing yourself to others
- Being "perfect"

---

## 🎯 Remember the Goal

```
Learn → Understand → Build → Teach → Master
```

**You're not just learning to code.**  
**You're learning to think like a programmer.**  
**You're building a foundation for life.**

Every day you show up, you're winning. 🏆

## 💪 Motivation Mantras

When it gets hard, remember:

> "I am not bad at programming. I am learning programming."

> "Errors are not failures. They're feedback."

> "Slow progress is still progress."

> "Everyone was a beginner once."

> "I can do hard things."
