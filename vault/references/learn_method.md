# The Experimental Learning Method (ADHD Edition)

## Core Philosophy
**"You're not taking notes - you're making a to-do list of experiments"**

Learning happens through breaking, fixing, and discovering - not through memorization.

---

## The Three Learning Questions
Every session, ask:
1. **"What can I break?"** (Hypothesis)
2. **"How did it break?"** (Experiment)  
3. **"Why did it break that way?"** (Learning)

---
## Method 1: Experiment Journaling (For Books/Docs)

### Template
```markdown
# Date: [whenever]
## What I Think Will Happen:
"If I do X, it should..."

## What I Actually Did:
[paste exact code]

## What Actually Happened:
"Result: ..."

## Why I Was Wrong/Right:
"Because..."

## What I Learned:
"Key insight..."

## Try Tomorrow:
"What if I..."
```
### Example Entry

```markdown
# Tonight's Victim: Pointers

What I think it does:
"Stores a memory address"

Let me try to break it:
int *p;
*p = 42;  // YOLO

What happened:
"Segfault"

Why:
"Pointer pointed to random memory, not allocated memory"
```

---
### Method 2: Video/Course Learning (Two-Pass System)
### Pass 1: Treasure Hunt (During Video)

Only capture THREE things:
markdown
```markdown
# [Course Name] - [Topic/Date]

## 🎯 Commands/Code:
[exact commands they typed]

## 🤔 WTF Moments:
- "Why did they..."
- "What's that..."

## 💡 Try Later:
- Thing at timestamp
- Variation of their example
```

Pass 2: Lab Time (After Video)
```markdown
markdown

```markdown
# Lab: Testing [Topic]

## Their Code:
[what they showed]

## My Version:
[your modification]

## What Happened:
[result]

## Learned:
[insight]
```

## The "Pause Game" for Live Learning

When instructor shows code:
1. **PAUSE**
2. **PREDICT** - "I think this will..."
3. **PLAY** - Watch result
4. **WRITE** - Only if surprised
```markdown
Predicted: [outcome]
Actually: [what happened]
Because: [why you were wrong/right]
```

## Key Principles

#### ❌ What DOESN'T Work (Old Way)
```markdown
`Read → Copy → Memorize → Forget → Burnout`
```
#### ✅ What WORKS (ADHD Way)
```markdown
`See → Try → Break → Fix → Document → Understand`
```

### The One Thing Rule
- Each lesson: catch ONE thing deeply
- Better to truly understand 1 concept than memorize 10
### Your Learning Flow
```markdown
Discovery → Hypothesis → Experiment → Result → Understanding
    ↓           ↓             ↓          ↓          ↓
"I wonder"  "It should"    [try it]  "WTF/Cool"  "Because"
```

---
### Daily Practice Template
```markdown
# Today's Destruction Log: [Date]

## Target: [concept/function/feature]

## Experiments:
1. What if I [variation 1]?
   - Result: 
   
2. What if I [variation 2]?
   - Result:

3. What if I [completely break it]?
   - Result:

## Biggest Surprise:
[what you didn't expect]

## Actually Understood:
[one thing that clicked]

## Questions for Tomorrow:
[what to explore next]
```
---
## Remember

- **You're a scientist**, not a student
- **Your notebook is a lab journal**, not lecture notes
- **Breaking things teaches you their boundaries**
- **"Wrong" results are the best teachers**
- **Confusion is the feeling of learning happening**
---
## The Golden Rule

If you're not typing code and seeing results, you're not learning programming - you're just reading about it.

**Your mantra**: "Let me try that and see what happens"

---
## Quick Reference Card

When learning anything new:

1. 📖 See something interesting
2. 🤔 "What if I..."
3. ⌨️ Try it
4. 💥 Break it
5. 🔧 Fix it
6. 📝 Write what happened
7. 🎯 Understand why
8. 🔁 Repeat with variation

---
## Victory Metrics

You're succeeding when your notes contain:

- "Holy shit, it worked!"
- "WTF, why did that happen?"
- "Oh THAT'S why!"
- "Tomorrow I'm gonna try..."

You're NOT succeeding when your notes contain:

- Copy-pasted textbook definitions
- Things you "should memorize"
- Perfect, clean information
- No personal experiments
